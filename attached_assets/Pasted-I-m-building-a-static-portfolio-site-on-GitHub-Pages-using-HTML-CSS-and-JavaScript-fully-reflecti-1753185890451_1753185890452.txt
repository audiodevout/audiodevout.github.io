I’m building a static portfolio site on GitHub Pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fully reflecting my style: dark theme (#000 black background, #fff white text) with neon accents in dynamic HSL (around hsl(180,100%,50%)). Typography uses Google Fonts’ Doto for a clean, minimalist Bauhaus-inspired look. The site features glitch effects—flickering neon text, subtle pixel distortions, and digital noise overlays. The cursor is a custom crosshair with a glitchy trailing effect and subtle axis/grid markers around it, reinforcing a cybernetic aesthetic. Neon colors are carefully balanced for strong contrast ensuring the cursor and all text/UI elements remain clearly visible, readable, and accessible in a futuristic style.

All content and metadata—including text blocks, navigation links, image/audio/video paths, and written descriptions—are loaded dynamically from a single centralized file named portfolio_data.js. This file serves as the single source of truth powering galleries, audio players, video embeds, text pages, download lists, and all written content across the site. This makes content management modular, scalable, and easy to update.

All styling is contained exclusively in CSS files, maintaining separation of concerns and ease of customization.

The site’s main page title dynamically switches every few seconds between "Atharva Gupta", "asymmetrica", and "audiodevout", reinforcing brand identity in a subtle but engaging way.

In the background, the site features animated particles drifting and shifting colors in sync with the neon accent palette, adding depth and motion without distracting from content.

Site structure includes:

Home (welcome and nav)

Audio (stream-only neon-glow custom players, no downloads)

Images (gallery thumbnails → detail pages, right-click disabled, no downloads)

Videos (YouTube-style embeds + description pages, no downloads)

Texts (markdown-rendered text pages)

Downloads (list with dedicated pages, no direct media downloads)

About (bio, education, exhibitions, artist statement, projects)

Contact (static Formspree form + obfuscated email)

Thesis (view-only PDF with abstract/context)

Navigation is a fixed, keyboard-accessible navbar with smooth glitch-style page transitions. Accessibility features include alt text, aria-labels, full responsiveness, and mobile-friendly design. Media is protected with right-click disabled and no direct download links, ensuring streaming/view-only.

Content is auto-generated from portfolio_data.js with well-commented code for easy additions. Floating descriptive text drifts slowly with kinetic smoothness, hover states trigger blinking/glowing neon accents, and the audio player glows and flickers to match the site’s vibe. Optional extras include markdown support, lazy loading images, and smooth CSS/JS page transitions.

Contact info and socials (Instagram, YouTube/Vimeo, SoundCloud/Bandcamp, GitHub, LinkedIn, Are.na, etc.) appear clearly with optional downloadable CV or press kit and newsletter signup. The site includes SEO meta tags, favicon, and a small last-updated footer.

Overall, the portfolio feels clean Bauhaus-minimalist fused with glitchy neon cybernetic visuals—striking, professional, immersive, accessible, and perfectly tuned for a futuristic artist identity.
