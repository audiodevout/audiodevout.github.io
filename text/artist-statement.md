# Artist Statement

I make experimental systems that combine sound, light, code, and kinetic structures. My work explores the edges between control and collapse—between what is designed and what breaks, flickers, loops, or hums out of place.

I'm interested in tinnitus, entropy, machine rhythms, and the emotional textures of noise and silence. I often build my own instruments, use generative processes, and work with tools like TouchDesigner to create immersive and reactive experiences.

Each piece is a system with its own quirks, sometimes meditative, sometimes glitchy and unstable—always slightly off-centre.
