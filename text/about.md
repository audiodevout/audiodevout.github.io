# About Atharva Gupta

I'm an artist from Ajmer, India, currently based in the Netherlands. I study **MADTech** (Media Arts Design & Technology) at the Frank Mohr Institute in Groningen.

## What I Make

I create experimental systems that combine **sound, light, code, and kinetic structures**. My work explores the edges between control and collapse—between what is designed and what breaks, flickers, loops, or hums out of place.

Working primarily with installation, kinetic sculpture, and generative media, I investigate our relationship with technology and surveillance. These pieces often incorporate machine learning, computer vision, and algorithmic composition as both subject matter and creative tools.

## Current Research

My research focuses on the **politics and poetics of machine sensing**—how devices see, hear, and interpret the world around us, and what this means for human agency and privacy.

I'm particularly interested in:
- **Surveillance aesthetics** and the visual language of machine vision
- **Kinetic sound** installations using motorized systems
- **Generative composition** through algorithmic processes
- **Critical making** as a research methodology

## Background

- **2024-Present**: MADTech, Frank Mohr Institute, Groningen, Netherlands
- **2023**: Various exhibitions and installations exploring surveillance and machine vision
- **2022**: Beginning of generative music composition practice
- **2021**: Started working with kinetic systems and motor-driven installations

## Philosophy

Each work is an experiment in finding beauty within systems of control, and agency within structures of constraint. I believe in making work that questions our technological moment while remaining fundamentally curious about the possibilities for human expression within and against algorithmic systems.

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects that push the boundaries between art, technology, and critical inquiry. If you're working on something that resonates with these themes, I'd love to hear from you.
