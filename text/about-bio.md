# About

I'm Atharva Gupta (aka *asymmetrica*), an artist from Ajmer, India, currently based in the Netherlands. I study MADTech at the Frank Mohr Institute in Groningen.

After finishing a Bachelor's in Psychology, Sociology and Literature from Christ University, Bangalore and a Master's in Arts and Culture (Arts, Cognition and Criticism) from the University of Groningen, I am now following the MADTech program.

My work includes audiovisual installations, kinetic sound objects, and generative media, often investigating the politics and poetics of sensing through machines. I'm interested in how machines can sound and move in ways that aren't perfectâ€”things that hum, glitch, or fall out of sync.

I build my own instruments and make generative, interactive pieces that you can see and hear. It's often a little messy, sometimes meditative, and always a bit weird.

## Tools I Use

I mostly work with TouchDesigner, Ableton, Arduino, and sensors. Not limited to all of these though. I mix code, sound, and physical stuff to build pieces that react and move.

## Influences

Artists like Trimpin, Studio Zimoun, and Reuben Margolin for their sound and movement. Christina Kubisch and Martin Messier for their unique sound and kinetic work. Ryoji Ikeda, Memo Akten, and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer for their tech, visuals, and generative work.

Ai Weiwei, Hito Steyerl, and Paolo Cirio for the political and critical edge. Dries Depoorter and Lauren McCarthy for their social tech and interactive ideas. Zach Blas and Addie Wagenknecht for pushing boundaries on surveillance and tech.

V2 Rotterdam, iii Den Haag, and NP3 Groningen as inspiring spaces and collectives.
