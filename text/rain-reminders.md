# Rain Reminders: Process Notes

*A kinetic sound installation exploring tinnitus and industrial rhythms*

## Concept

Rain Reminders began with my experience of tinnitus—that persistent ringing that sits between silence and sound. I wanted to create something that could translate this internal auditory experience into a physical, shared space.

The piece centers around a large rain stick that rotates mechanically, creating both the expected gentle rainfall sounds and unexpected industrial rhythms as the mechanism itself becomes part of the composition.

## Technical Implementation

The installation uses:
- Custom-built rotating mechanism with stepper motors
- Arduino-based control system with multiple sensors
- Contact microphones to capture both intended and incidental sounds
- Proximity sensors that affect rotation speed based on audience presence

The rain stick itself was constructed using traditional materials—cactus spines and small stones—but housed within a framework that allows for mechanical rotation at varying speeds.

## Process Discoveries

What surprised me most during development was how the mechanical elements began to dominate the soundscape. The motor noise, bearing friction, and structural resonances created their own rhythmic patterns that competed with (and sometimes overwhelmed) the original rain sounds.

Rather than eliminate these "unwanted" sounds, I decided to embrace them. They became a metaphor for how tinnitus interrupts and reshapes our auditory landscape—neither fully natural nor artificial, but something in between.

## Installation Notes

The piece requires:
- Minimum 3m x 3m floor space
- Ceiling height of at least 2.5m
- Standard power (220V)
- Quiet environment for optimal sound clarity

The rotation speed can be adjusted from barely perceptible (one rotation per minute) to almost aggressive (one rotation every few seconds), allowing for different experiential modes throughout the day.
